From New Zealand, I have recently arrived in Melbourne after travelling across Australia and liked it here too much.  I’m a passionate technophile working in the Cloud Engineering and Systems Architecture space. I love to engage with developers to advocate for DevOps practices and get involved with release engineering to improve the delivery of new and existing software using modern cloud native technologies. **I am currently looking for new opportunities.**

I have a keen interest in the technical design and testing of scalable, highly available systems and developing any extra tools to make releases happen smoother and safer. I currently spend plenty of time building CI/CD pipelines deploying micro-services onto Kubernetes clusters and monitoring them.

I also like to engage in Open Source projects. You can find me in the Kubernetes Slack channel. I also work on silly spare time side projects such as __udraw.me__, Gofit and use machine learning to study cats hunting mice.

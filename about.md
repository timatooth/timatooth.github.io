Currently located in Christchurch I work on cloud based IoT software deployment. I work on a few personal projects such as udraw and other silly experiments with flying drones.

## Photography
I like to keep photography as a hobby after doing many professional gigs in Dunedin including risking life and lens at the student run events at Otago such as Hyde Street. I'm on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/timatooth) and Instagram [@timatooth](https://instagram.com/timatooth)

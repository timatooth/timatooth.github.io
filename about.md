I'm currently a DevOps Engineer at Fairfax keeping the New Zealand news site
Stuff running. I work on a few personal projects such as udraw and other silly
things. I'm also getting back into photography as a hobby.

## Photography
I like to keep photography as a hobby after doing many professional gigs in Dunedin including risking life and lens at the student run events at Otago such as Hyde Street. I'm on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/timatooth) and Instagram [@timatooth](https://instagram.com/timatooth)

## Contact Me

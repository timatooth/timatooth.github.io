Hello there! This is my software development blog. I like to write about the daily findings and challenges in the JavaScript world and report on my occasional silly side projects. Recently finished university and now ready to get amongst the code full time!

# Photography
I like to keep photography as a hobby after doing many professional gigs in Dunedin including risking life and lens at the student run events at Otago such as Hyde Street. I'm on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/timatooth) and Instagram [@timatooth](https://instagram.com/timatooth)
